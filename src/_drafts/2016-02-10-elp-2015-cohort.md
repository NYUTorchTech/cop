This COP will be closed for members of the 2015 Emerging Leaders Program

##Planned Goal/Outcome
The goal of this COP is to continue to develop leadership qualities among the NYU community members that were selected to participate in the Emerging Leaders Program cohort of 2015. As these community members have jobs that work in or with technology at the University collaborative and networking opportunities will be part of the COP. A final goal of this COP is to provide problem solving and mentoring to common workplace scenarios.
