This group is for any member of the NYU community who regularly uses video technology, whether for content acquisition, post-production or video conferencing and presentations. 

##Planned Goal/Outcome
The intended outcome of this group will be to share knowledge and resources amongst the community of video practitioners university-wide. 

##Processes and Practices
This community will help foster awareness and knowledge sharing amongst the many disparate video practitioners university-wide. This goal can be achieved in a number of ways, including new equipment demos and organized facility tours.
