The purpose of this COP is to foster conversation between central and distributed technology resources. This group can also direct community members to other COPs once more COPs have been created.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Navigating the bureaucratic landscape that is NYU's technology services is a daunting task. Many times members of both central and distributed technology resources are locked into silos in which they only have to interact with members of their silos. The NYU CDTS Happy Hour Group seeks to create social bonds that break down those silos and will allow all NYU technology services to collaborate and share knowledge.

##Processes and Practices
Every other month, the group will put together a happy hour or some type of social event in which members of the group and meet and socialize. We are distinct from Torch Tech because our main goal is to foster social relationships opposed to Torch Tech's more professional development oriented goals.
