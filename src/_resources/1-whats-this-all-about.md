## What's a "Community of Practice"?

A Community of Practice (CoP) is an informal network of people who share a common interest. It can include as few as five people, and diversity is encouraged - i.e., membership should consist of individuals from across different units from the University. A CoP has has a targeted scope and provides learning value to its members with no predefined lifetime for communities of practice.

## How Do I Get Started?

### I have an idea, what next?

* Start talking to people and taking names
* Email <a href="mailto:cop-group@nyu.edu">cop-group@nyu.edu</a> to see if we know of others that share your interests
* Check <a href="../resources/2-cop-101.html">CoP 101</a> for ideas and best practices

### I want to join an existing community

* Read over the <a href="../#join">list of existing communities</a> for one that matches your interests
* Reach out to CoP contact 

### I want to register a new community

* Complete the registration form
* Check <a href="../resources/2-cop-101.html">CoP 101</a> for ideas and best practices

## Helpful Hints to Get You Going...

There are several additional things you should consider:

* Is there another CoP that matches what you’re trying to establish? If so, consider joining and contributing to the existing community rather than reinventing the wheel.
* Consider gathering a “coalition of the willing” prior to establishing your CoP.
* Plan ahead - starting up and maintaining a CoP will require a fairly significant time commitment. Seriously consider if you’ve got the time to commit to this endeavor.
* Think about how frequently members will meet. Each CoP is different. Think about what makes sense for your community.
* Determine the right communication channels for your community. This will likely include the creation of a <a href="//www.nyu.edu/its/groups/">Google Group</a> and may also include blogs, wikis or social media. 
* Have fun! CoP’s can provide a tremendous amount of value to its members as well as great networking opportunities with your fellow NYU colleagues. If you start one up and it winds up fizzling, don’t take it personally or lose heart.
* Contact <a href="mailto:cop-group@nyu.edu">cop-group@nyu.edu</a> for guidance, questions, suggestions.
