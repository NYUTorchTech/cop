### What's a "Community of Practice"?
According to Alice Cassidy, Principal at In View Education and Professional Development:

 > "A Community of Practice is an informal network of people (which can range in number from 25 or fewer to 500 or more) who share a common interest and work on aspects of it through face to face meetings and seminars; blogs, listservs and other online communication tools; and other formats and techniques"

At NYU, we take a slightly different view; we define the lower bound of the range as 5, rather than 25. Furthermore, a Community of Practice at NYU should have diversity - i.e., membership should consist of individuals from across different units from the University.

### How does this differ from a task force?
A task force is designed to tackle a particular problem or issue, sometimes with a fairly broad scope and usually with a fixed lifetime. A community of practice, on the other hand, has a targeted scope and provides learning value to its members. There is usually no predefined lifetime for communities of practice.

### What other resources do you offer?
The resources we offer are listed on the NYU Communities of Practice website.

### Thanks. How do I get started?
The first step is to submit an application to the Torchtech Community of Practice Operating Committee. The application form is located on the [NYU Communities of Practice website](/#start).

Once your application is received, you will be invited to meet with the committee to discuss your plans for the community in detail.

### Okay. I'd like to advertise the new Community of Practice - how can I do so?
There's a directory of communities of practice on this site where your community will be listed. You can also invite folks to join your community through the message board on this site.

### What else should I know about communities of practice?
There are several additional things you should consider before deciding to create a new community of practice:

* Is there another community of practice at NYU that matches what you're trying to establish? If so, consider joining and contributing to the existing community rather than attempt to reinvent the wheel.
* Communities of Practice continue to exist as long as they continue to provide value to their members. If you start one up and it winds up fizzling, don't take it personally or lose heart.
* Consider gathering a "coalition of the willing" prior to establishing your community of practice. These will be the diehard members of the community that can help shoulder some of the heavy lifting involved in starting up and maintaining a community of practice.
* Starting up and maintaining a community of practice will require a fairly significant time commitment from you, even if you've got a group of rock stars to help manage the community. Seriously consider if you've got the time to commit to this endeavor.
* Think about how frequently members will meet. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Each community of practice is different. Some will undoubtedly meet more frequently than others. Think about what makes sense for your community.
* Figure out the right communication channels for your community. At the most basic level, you'll most likely want to create a Google Group to communicate via email. Other forms of disseminating information (e.g., a website, a blog, etc.) will require a certain time commitment and skill set to be maintained properly.
* Last, but not least, have fun! A community of practice can provide a tremendous amount of value to its members. It also provides a great networking opportunity - you can get to know folks from across the University (perhaps even the GNU) that you normally might not get to meet or interact with during the course of your daily activities.
