Created by administrators, for administrators, Communicators@NYU is a professional support network for NYU professionals whose primary role/function falls under the diverse umbrella of marketing communications. Whether you specialize in content marketing, public relations, advertising, social media, or everything in between, our community is here to serve NYU community members who work in or are looking to gain exposure to the University’s digital marketing and communications ecosystem.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Communicators@NYU’s goal is to provide safe physical and online spaces for open dialogue about the marketing communications field at and beyond NYU. Our community is also a vehicle for facilitating the exchange of comments, questions, ideas, studies, and other tidbits that are of interest to marketers and communicators on campus.

##Processes and Practices
Communicators@NYU hosts alternating lunch and after work meetups on and off campus every month. We also provide members with shared access to online resources via our NYU Group, including links to industry best practices, conferences, professional workshops, and learning materials.
