This community is for anyone interested in:

* Communication and Collaboration
* Web 2.0 and Digital Teaching Tools
* Online and Blended Learning
* Emerging Technologies
* Instructional Design
* Educational Policy and Leadership
* Mobile Learning
* Technology Infrastructure

...and the many other technology enhanced efforts occurring at NYU.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Increase awareness of the eclectic technology enhanced projects and initiatives while also identifying common practices, efforts, and resources between schools and departments across NYU.  How can instructional designers and technologists crowd source resources and ideas to achieve both their organizational and personal goals?

##Processes and Practices
Monthly meetings per semester to share current projects, initiatives, successes and hurdles.
