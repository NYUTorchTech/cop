##Planned Goal/Outcome
The TEE CoP is open to, and welcomes, all full-time instructional/educational designers and technologists from across NYU’s schools and global sites. As outlined in the [Instructional Technology Committee (ITC) charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3Kc679iKlFrm4ln-FbSWAx9g3Sbj3OmFdvnJ0Xy37Y/edit), the role of an instructional technologist at NYU is to engage and collaborate with faculty around pedagogy, design and technology. Over the past several years, the work of this Committee has been instrumental in establishing and bringing together NYU’s instructional technologists et. al on a consistent basis to discuss and surface important topics, current and future use-cases, to the standing Teaching and Learning Governance and Advisory groups. 

The TEE CoP will exist alongside the ITC and aims to provide a venue to come together to discuss member chosen topics in further detail, share, advance our knowledge as a community and support each other in our day-to-day work around key areas of our work.
