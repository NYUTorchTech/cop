Our community is for faculty members, administrators, and staff. We plan to open the group to students in the future. Our purpose is to provide opportunities to learn about UX, collaborate on related projects, and network across NYU.

## Planned Goal/Outcome

* Create a pool of participants for user testing.
* Discourage silos and encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration.
* Increase training and professional development opportunities on UX principles and practices.

## Processes and Practices

Our quarterly meetings are a forum for members to share their projects and discuss ideas. The community will develop a web resource of UX best practices. Subcommittees will address specific member needs like user testing. The community will also sponsor learning and networking events like workshops and webinars.
