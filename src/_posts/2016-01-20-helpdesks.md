The helpdesk community of practice is for people who work in helpdesks and support centers throughout NYU, and others interested in helpdesk activities. The purpose is to hold conversations between professionals, share ideas about our practice, ask questions, discuss issues and practiced solutions, and build relationships between staff in support centers throughout NYU.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Improved relationship between support centers. Improved hand-off and collaboration between support centers. Improved experience for clients. More specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:
- Are there shared values, and if so what are they? 
- What are our pain points? Obstacles?
- What would make our practice easier? More efficient? More effective?
- How do we connect with other helpdesks? What are the entry points? Who are the contacts? What are the requirements?

##Processes and Practices
* Monthly meeting.
* Blog / WP site.
* A day in the life 
* Develop and share helpdesk toolkit.
