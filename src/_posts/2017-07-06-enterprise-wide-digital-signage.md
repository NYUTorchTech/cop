First our group will define a new NYU IT supported enterprise-wide service model and technology and then we will work to implement that and extend to interested groups 

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Consistent digital signage solution for all university departments and schools. Leverage shared licensing to reduce costs and active service support from NYU IT. 

##Processes and Practices
These are being defined.
