This community is open to any developers, application managers, or system administrators, actively working on, or interested in learning more about NYU's enterprise content management system. 

Prior experience with Java/JSP, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Apache Sling, OSGI, or Jackrabbit Oak is not required, but highly recommended, as we can get into pretty deep discussions on occasion.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
This community fosters an environment for sharing and learning, offering a platform for code collaboration, floating new ideas, and access to the previous experiences of others working in the system. We are also connected with the greater AEM community throughout the US (and beyond), and have attended meetups for developers outside of NYU.

##Processes and Practices
We meet as a community on a monthly basis and share progress and recent developments among all groups involved. Lively configuration and code discussions have been known to launch ambitious, successful projects out of these meetings. It can be a very fun and exciting place, and especially serves as a great collaborative resource for solo developers who are not often afforded the opportunity to work with others regularly.
