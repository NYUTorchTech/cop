The Social Media Ambassadors is a group of social media administrators and professionals at New York University. The group is designed to promote sharing, learning and community building here at NYU. Social media content (campaigns, updates, etc.) are encouraged with added context to the &ldquo;why&rsquo;s and how&rsquo;s&rdquo; behind them. The group is open to those who currently work with or will be working with social media at the university level.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
Joining the Social Media Ambassadors provides a variety of benefits including:

* Opportunity to build and grow your NYU network
* The chance to better collaborate and build successful social media campaigns with fellow social media managers at the university
* Networking opportunities with industry professionals (including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
* Updates regarding workshops and training sessions to improve social media knowledge

##Processes and Practices
* Two meetings per semester targeted at providing both educational and networking opportunities
* Monthly messages to provide updates on the on-going social media changes taking place
