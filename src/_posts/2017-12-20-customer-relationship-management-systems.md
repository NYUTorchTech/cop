Bring together CRM users and those interested in learning more about CRM systems to share experiences, best practices, product information, and (perhaps) licensing plans

##Planned Goal/Outcome
The main benefit will be increased expertise on the part of CRM users at University units, benefiting the business processes of those units. Secondary benefits may include eventual group licensing agreements (with attendant savings) and better training opportunities.

##Processes and Practices
Though this is a brand new group, we expect to meet periodically to share, bring in speakers / experts, meet virtually occasionally, and keep a mailing list engaged in between in-person meetings.
