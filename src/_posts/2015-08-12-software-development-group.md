This community is for all NYU developers - globally. We will start with the NYC community and expand towards international campuses. The community will be a conglomerate for front end, back end, full stack and QA engineers. 

##Planned Goal/Outcome
This community aims to unite all NYU developers to provide a common forum to share knowledge and best practices in development for one unified NYU brand and image. The group seeks to enrich our developers' skill set and inspire them by gathering them for free technology events throughout the city. It can be a key instrument to retaining top developer talent at NYU. 

##Processes and Practices
A weekly newsletter will be distributed on engaging tech events taking place in New York City. We will meet weekly in person for code reviews and development workshops. There will be a monthly meet-up at NYU to address administrative concerns and to meet/greet new members. Members will be encouraged to attend hackathons together.
