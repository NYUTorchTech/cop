This is a community for educational designers, faculty, and administrators who are interested in exploring how the design of the physical classroom, including technology integrations, can support active learning strategies and support the mission of each School and the University as a whole.

##Planned Goal/Outcome
The work of this community will contribute to understanding the impacts of diverse classroom designs on an array of learning goals. The community will develop a database of use cases across campus which will provide administrators, faculty, and educational designers actionable intelligence on how to apply classroom design practices to meet learning and strategic goals. The work will further study the feasibility of and alternative options for implementing design strategies with consideration of practical, cultural, and fiscal constraints that may limit conventional design approaches.

##Processes and Practices
This will be a cross-disciplinary exploration of learning spaces which explores design from the vantage of architecture, active learning pedagogy, CSCL, furniture design, interior design, educational history, and more. Participants will share examples/images of classrooms in use at both NYU and non-NYU Schools and analyze relationships between the physical space and the modes of content delivery associated with those spaces. We will examine trends in classroom design for higher education and attempt to derive benchmarks for developing our our own best practices and projects. We will work together to identify how different classroom classroom configurations may afford or constrain specific active learning goals, and identify opportunities for making fiscally responsible improvements.
